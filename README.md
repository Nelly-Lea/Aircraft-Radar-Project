Users have the option to access additional details about flights, including flight numbers, arrival times,the weather in the departure and arrival countries of the flight and more. Furthermore, the system allows users to review the flight history between two specified dates. Additionally, it provides information about upcoming holidays around the chosen dates.

## Goals and features of this project

- **MVVM Architecture:** Implements the MVVM architecture for the entire user process, including the use of Command classes, UserControls patterns, and a presentation layer based on WPF.
  
- **API Integration:** Utilizes various JSON-based APIs from different websites for database connectivity, storage, and data retrieval using Entity Framework.
